Uploading Projects, Folders and Files via github.com Web Interface
==================================================================
1. First, copy the current location in the address bar and open it in a new tab.
2. Now that we've duplicated the browser tab (same URL)... 
   it's time to start Uploading:
3. Most of the time we can just drag and drop the selected files and folders and they'll be reucrsively uploaded.
   However, in case we've selected 100 (or more) we need to make a workaround since GitHub limits us to less than 100 each time.
   This is also useful if we have an empty folder and GitHub refuses to upload/create it :
   3.1 Press 'Create new file' and type the directory name exactly 'as is' and then type /
       a folder will be created BUT we still have to create a file. 
       So choose something like 'dummy' (or a shorter but _rememberable_ name).
   3.2 Upload additonal files and folders (the limit will still be less than a 100).
   3.3 Now and only now can be Delete the dummy file. 
       NOTE: if we delete the file *before* adding or creating other files/folders 
       then GitHub will notice we tried to trick it into creating an empty directory
       and will immediately delete it too *NO questions_asked* !!!
